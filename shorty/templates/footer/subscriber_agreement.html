question for a Service, they will be able to request information about your

we can continue to contact you and send any notices required hereunder. If you

legal theory, will be resolved by arbitration administered by the Botswana
Institute of Arbitrators (&quot;BIA&quot;) in accordance with its Commercial
Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related

any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the Republic of

termination of this Agreement. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you
